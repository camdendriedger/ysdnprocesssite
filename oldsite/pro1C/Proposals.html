Additional teams would join the settlement every two years, with the intention that by 2035 there would be over twenty people living and working on Mars.[19] The astronaut selection process began on 22 April 2013.[41]</p>

    <p>Artist’s impression of the Phoenix spacecraft as it lands on Mars.
In December 2013, mission concept studies for an unmanned Mars mission were contracted with Lockheed Martin and Surrey Satellite Technology for a demonstration mission to be launched in 2017 and land on Mars in 2018. It would be based on the design of the successful 2007 NASA Phoenix lander,[43] and provide proof of concept for a subset of the key technologies for a later permanent human settlement on Mars.[44] Upon submission of Lockheed Martin’s Proposal Information Package,[43] Mars One released a Request for Proposals[45] for the various payloads on the lander.</p>
