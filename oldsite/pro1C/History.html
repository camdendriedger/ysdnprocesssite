    <p>The concept for Mars One began in 2011 with discussions between the two founders, Bas Lansdorp and Arno Wielders.[13]</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Mars One publicly announced the concept in May 2012 for a one-way trip to Mars, with the intention of an initial robotic precursor mission in 2020 and transporting the first human colonists to Mars in 2024.[15] In a 2015 debate, Bas Lansdrop clarified that “we’re not going to do, I think, the current design of the mission” and “Mars One’s goal is not to send humans to Mars in 2032 with a $6 billion budget and 14 launches. Our goal is to send humans to Mars, period.”[16] According to Mars One’s website, “It is Mars One’s goal to establish a permanent human settlement on Mars.”[17]</p>

    <p>In December 2013, Mars One announced its concept of a robotic precursor mission in 2020, two years later than had been conceptually planned in the 2012 announcements. The robotic lander would be “built by Lockheed Martin based on the design used for NASA’s Phoenix and InSight missions, as well as a communications orbiter built by Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd.”[27] In February 2015, Lockheed Martin and Surrey Satellite Technology confirmed that contracts on the initial study phase begun in late 2013 had run out and additional contracts had not been received for further progress on the robotic missions. Plans have been disclosed to raise the US$200 million or more needed to support the initial robotic mission,[12][27] but some critics do not find the economic plans to raise money from private investors and exclusive broadcasting rights to be sufficient to support the initial, or follow-on, mission(s).</p>

    <p> Mars One selected a second-round pool of astronaut candidates in 2013 of 1058 people—”586 men and 472 women from 107 countries”—from a larger number of 202,586 who initially showed interest on the Mars One website, although this number is heavily disputed. Former Mars One candidate Dr. Joseph Roche claims the number of initial applicants was only 2,761,[28] which Mars One later conceded via YouTube video.[29]</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Mars One announced a partnership with Uwingu on 3 March 2014, stating that the program would use Uwingu’s map of Mars in all of their planned missions.[30][31] Kristian von Bengtson began work on Simulation Mars Home for crew on 24 March 2014.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The second-round pool was whittled down to 705 candidates (418 men and 287 women) in the beginning of May 2014. 353 were removed due to personal considerations.[32] After the medical physical requirement, which was similar to a normal FAA exam plus EKG, due either to financial, health or access reasons, only 660 candidates remained.[29] Notably, some applicants were notified of life-threatening conditions such as early-stage cancer and were able to immediately begin treatment.[33] These selected persons will then begin the interview process following which several teams of two men and two women will be compiled. The teams will then begin training full-time for a potential future mission to Mars, while individuals and teams may be selected out during training if they are not deemed suitable for the mission.[32]</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Mars One selected a third-round pool of astronaut candidates in 2015 of 100 people — “50 men and 50 women who successfully passed the second round. The candidates come from all around the world, namely 39 from the Americas, 31 from Europe, 16 from Asia, 7 from Africa, and 7 from Oceania”.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>In a video posted on 19 of March 2015, Lansdorp said that because of delays in the robotic precursor mission, the first crew will not set down on Mars until 2027.[36] In August 2015, Lansdorp reiterated that their 12-year plan for landing humans on Mars by 2027 is subject to constant improvement and updates.[37]</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>As of late 2016 Mars One had changed its first date to send humans to Mars to 2024.[40]</p>
