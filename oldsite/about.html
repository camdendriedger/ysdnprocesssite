    <h1>Mars One.</h1>

    <p>Mars One is an organization that has proposed to land the first humans on Mars and establish a permanent human colony there by 2032.[1][2]</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Mars One consists of two entities: the not-for-profit Mars One Foundation, and the for-profit company Mars One Ventures. The Mars One Foundation, based in the Netherlands, implements and manages the mission. Mars One Ventures holds all monetization rights, including broadcasting rights.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The private spaceflight project is led by Dutch entrepreneur Bas Lansdorp, who announced the Mars One project in May 2012.[3]</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Mars One's original concept included launching a robotic lander and orbiter as early as 2020 to be followed by a human crew of four in 2024 and one in 2026.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Organizers plan for the crew to be selected from applicants to become the first permanent residents of Mars with no plan of returning to Earth.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Partial funding options include a proposed television documentary program documenting the journey.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The project's schedule, technical and financial feasibility, and ethics, have been criticized by scientists, engineers and those in the aerospace industry.[4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11]</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>In February 2015, the primary contractors on the initial pre-Phase A contracts had completed all studies paid for by Mars One at that time.[12] The current state of the Mission Plan Deliverables (either in the form of Studies or actual Hardware) will be tracked in Table 2 in the Technology section.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The Mars One organization is the controlling stockholder of the for-profit Interplanetary Media Group. </p>
